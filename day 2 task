Differences between HTTP v1.1 vs HTTP v2

HTTP2 is a binary protocol and HTTP V1.1 is a Textual.
HTTP2 is fully multiplexed and HTTP V1.1 is ordered and blocked.
HTTP2 can use one TCP connection for parallelism and HTTP V1.1 requires multiple TCP connections.
HTTP2 uses header compression to reduce overhead, Not is available in HTTP V 1.1
HTTP2 allows servers to “push” responses proactively into client caches that are not available in HTTP V1.1
Objects  and their internal representation

Objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.


We can define object with curly bracket {}
For example :
var car = {};

We can assign keys and values using two methods.

Using dot:             car.color  = “red”;
 Using square bracket :  car[“color”] = “red”;

Where color is key and red is the value.

The value is unsigned key is undefined;
